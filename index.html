                        Water scarcity affects every continent. Climate change is making it worse. 
                        By 2025, half the world's population will live in water-stressed areas.

                        Kids, especially girls, miss school to fetch water. Clean water access = 
                        education access = breaking the cycle of poverty. It's that connected.
